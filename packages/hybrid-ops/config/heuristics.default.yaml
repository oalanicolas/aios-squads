# Heuristic Weights and Thresholds Configuration - DEFAULT TEMPLATE
# Version: 1.0
#
# This is the default configuration template for Pedro Valério's cognitive heuristics.
# Copy this file to heuristics.yaml to customize for your use case.
#
# Usage:
#   cp config/heuristics.default.yaml config/heuristics.yaml
#   nano config/heuristics.yaml  # Edit as needed
#
# All default values match the optimized settings from Story 1.10 (Performance Optimization).
# These values reflect Pedro Valério's cognitive patterns and decision-making style.

  # PV_BS_001: Future System Back-Casting
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  # Domain: Business Strategy
  # Algorithm: Design from desired end-state backwards to current actions
  #
  # Philosophy: Start with the desired outcome and work backwards to determine
  # the steps needed today. Prioritizes long-term vision over short-term market signals.

    weights:
      # Long-term vision clarity weight
      # How much weight to give to strategic clarity vs. current market alignment
      #
      # High value (0.8-1.0): Visionary mode - prioritize strategic clarity
      # Medium value (0.5-0.7): Balanced mode - consider both vision and market
      # Low value (0.0-0.4): Reactive mode - prioritize market signals
      #
      # Range: 0.0-1.0
      # Default: 0.9 (90% weight on vision)
      # Recommended: Keep high (0.8-0.9) for strategic planning
      end_state_vision: 0.9

      # Current market alignment weight
      # How much weight to give to current market conditions
      # Note: end_state_vision + current_market_signals should sum to 1.0
      #
      # Range: 0.0-1.0
      # Default: 0.1 (10% weight on market)
      # Recommended: Keep low (0.1-0.2) unless doing tactical planning
      current_market_signals: 0.1

    thresholds:
      # Minimum end-state clarity for "high" confidence classification
      # Below this = classified as "medium" or "low" confidence

  # PV_PA_001: Systemic Coherence Scan
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  # Domain: People Assessment
  # Algorithm: Assess people based on truthfulness, system fit, and skills
  #
  # Philosophy: Coherence (truthfulness) is non-negotiable and can veto
  # everything else. System fit is important. Skills are least important
  # because they can be developed if coherence and fit are present.
  #
  # VETO POWER: Truthfulness below threshold = automatic REJECT

    weights:
      # Truthfulness/Coherence weight - ⚠️  VETO POWER
      # This factor can veto the entire assessment if below threshold
      # Values >1.0 increase the veto penalty
      #
      # High value (1.0-1.5): Strict coherence requirement
      # Medium value (0.8-0.9): Balanced coherence requirement
      # Low value (0.7): Lenient coherence requirement (NOT RECOMMENDED)
      #
      # Range: 0.7-1.5

      #
      # Range: 0.0-1.0
      # Default: 0.8 (80% weight)
      # Recommended: 0.7-0.9 depending on culture importance
      system_adherence: 0.8

      # Technical skill/capability weight
      # How much weight to give to current skills and capabilities
      # Note: PV principle is "coherence > capability" so this is intentionally low
      #
      # Range: 0.0-1.0
      # Default: 0.3 (30% weight)
      # Recommended: Keep low (0.2-0.4) - skills can be developed

    thresholds:

      # Minimum weighted score for "REVIEW" recommendation
      # Between veto and approve thresholds = needs further assessment
      # Below veto = automatic REJECT
