# Heuristic Weights and Thresholds Configuration
# Version: 1.0
#
# All default values match Phase 1 hardcoded values in:
# utils/heuristic-compiler.js (lines 34-37, 105-110, 198-203)
#
# This configuration enables runtime calibration of Pedro Valério's decision heuristics
# without requiring code changes or redeployment.

version: "1.0"

heuristics:
  # PV_BS_001: Future System Back-Casting
  # Domain: Business Strategy
  # Algorithm: Design from desired end-state backwards
  PV_BS_001:
    weights:
      # Long-term vision clarity weight (how clear is the end-state?)
      # Higher value = prioritize strategic clarity over current market
      # Range: 0.0-1.0 | Default: 0.9 (90% weight on vision)
      end_state_vision: 0.9

      # Current market alignment weight (how aligned with current market signals?)
      # Higher value = prioritize market timing
      # Range: 0.0-1.0 | Default: 0.1 (10% weight on market)
      current_market_signals: 0.1

    thresholds:
      # Minimum end-state clarity for "high" confidence classification
      # Range: 0.0-1.0 | Default: 0.8 (80% clarity required)
      confidence: 0.8

      # Minimum weighted score for "HIGH" priority classification
      # Range: 0.0-1.0 | Default: 0.8 (80% score required)
      priority: 0.8

  # PV_PA_001: Systemic Coherence Scan
  # Domain: People Assessment
  # Algorithm: Assess people based on truthfulness, system fit, and skills
  PV_PA_001:
    weights:
      # Truthfulness/Coherence weight - VETO POWER
      # This factor can veto the entire assessment if below threshold
      # Higher value = prioritize coherence over all else
      # Range: 0.7-1.5 | Default: 1.0 (100% weight - maximum importance)
      truthfulness: 1.0

      # System adherence/fit weight (how well person fits the system?)
      # Higher value = prioritize cultural/systemic alignment
      # Range: 0.0-1.0 | Default: 0.8 (80% weight)
      system_adherence: 0.8

      # Technical skill/capability weight (how skilled is the person?)
      # Lower value reflects PV principle: coherence > capability
      # Range: 0.0-1.0 | Default: 0.3 (30% weight)
      skill: 0.3

    thresholds:
      # Minimum truthfulness score (below = automatic REJECT)
      # This is the VETO threshold - non-negotiable minimum
      # Range: 0.5-0.9 | Default: 0.6 (60% truthfulness required)
      veto: 0.6

      # Minimum weighted score for "APPROVE" recommendation
      # Range: 0.6-1.0 | Default: 0.8 (80% overall score required)
      approve: 0.8

      # Minimum weighted score for "REVIEW" recommendation
      # Between veto and approve thresholds
      # Range: 0.6-0.8 | Default: 0.7 (70% score required)
      review: 0.7

  # PV_PM_001: Automation Tipping Point
  # Domain: Process Management
  # Algorithm: Determine if task should be automated based on frequency and readiness
  PV_PM_001:
    weights:
      # Execution frequency weight (how often is task performed?)
      # Higher value = prioritize frequency in automation decision
      # Range: 0.0-1.0 | Default: 0.7 (70% weight)
      frequency: 0.7

      # Process standardization weight (how standardized is the task?)
      # Higher value = require more standardization before automating
      # Range: 0.0-1.0 | Default: 0.9 (90% weight - high importance)
      standardization: 0.9

      # Safety guardrails weight - VETO POWER
      # Missing guardrails = automatic rejection of automation
      # Range: 0.5-1.5 | Default: 1.0 (100% weight - maximum importance)
      guardrails: 1.0

    thresholds:
      # Executions per month threshold (tipping point for automation consideration)
      # Above this = task becomes automation candidate
      # Range: 1-10 executions/month | Default: 2 (twice per month)
      tipping_point: 2

      # Minimum standardization score required for automation
      # Range: 0.5-0.9 | Default: 0.7 (70% standardization required)
      standardization: 0.7

      # Minimum weighted score to recommend automation
      # Range: 0.5-0.9 | Default: 0.75 (75% overall score required)
      automate: 0.75

# Validation settings
validation:
  # Enforce strict validation rules (weights, thresholds, types)
  # true = reject invalid configs, false = warn and use defaults
  strict_mode: true

  # Minimum Axioma validation score required (from axioma-validator.js)
  # Range: 0.0-10.0 | Default: 7.0 (70% validation quality)
  minimum_score: 7.0

  # Enable veto power checks (truthfulness, guardrails)
  # true = respect VETO conditions, false = treat as normal weights
