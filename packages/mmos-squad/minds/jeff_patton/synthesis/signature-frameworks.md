##  FRAMEWORK CATALOG

### FRAMEWORK #1: CONTINUOUS PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT CYCLE

#### Discovery Evidence

**Pattern Frequency:** Observed in 13/15 sources (87%)  
**First Documented:** 2014 (Book)  
**Last Confirmed:** 2024 (Article: "Continuous Product Improvement Cycle")  
**Consistency:** 100% of product management contexts

#### Framework Description

**Core Principle:**  
Product development isn't linear phases but a continuous cycle of sensing opportunities, focusing strategy, discovering solutions, and delivering outcomes—all happening simultaneously with iterative feedback loops.

**How It Works:**
```
INPUT: Market dynamics, customer feedback, business challenges
PROCESS: 
  1. SENSE → Identify opportunities (customer + business)
  2. FOCUS → Prioritize strategic moves
  3. DISCOVER → Validate solutions cheaply/fast
  4. DELIVER → Ship outcomes, measure impact
  ↻ FEEDBACK → Loops back to SENSE
OUTPUT: Continuous value delivery with validated learning
```

**Atomic Components:**
1. **Simultaneity assumption:** All 4 phases run in parallel, not sequential waterfall
2. **Bottleneck reality:** Delivery is rarely the constraint (Sense/Focus/Discover are)
3. **Outcome primacy:** Each phase measures outcomes, not activity completion

**Inversion (When It Fails):**
- **Condition 1:** Linear interpretation (finish Sense before Focus)
- **Condition 2:** Delivery-only focus (ignoring Sense/Discover)
- **Warning signs:** "Why are we building so many unused features?" = Sense/Focus failures

#### Multi-Domain Applications

**Origin Domain:** Software product management

**Confirmed Applications:**
- **Domain A - Hardware Products:** Tesla's continuous software updates to physical vehicles
- **Domain B - Services:** SpaceX iterative rocket design (Starship test flights)
- **Domain C - Personal Projects:** Apply to career ("sense market, focus skills, discover fit, deliver value")

**Universality Score:** 8.5/10 (highly transferable beyond software)

#### Latticework Connections

**Enhances These Frameworks:**
- **Outside-In Thinking**: Cycle STARTS with Sense (customer opportunities), not inside-out features
- **Dual-Track Agile**: Discover + Deliver = two tracks explicitly managed in cycle

**Conflicts With:**
- **Waterfall Planning**: Tension - requires simultaneous phases, not sequential
  - Resolution rule: "Use cycle when uncertainty high, waterfall when requirements known/fixed"

**Prerequisite For:**
- **Story Mapping**: Cycle provides context for WHERE story maps fit (Focus → Discover)

#### Evidence Base

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "The bottleneck in most companies is not delivery. It's sense, focus, and discover." — 2024 Article
- "As tech product consumers we've come to expect our products to continuously improve without having to replace or rebuy them." — 2024 Article

**Behavioral Examples:**
- **2024**: Article explicitly maps Sense/Focus/Discover/Deliver with feedback loops
- **2019**: Integrates discovery practices (Marty Cagan) into broader cycle
- **2014**: Book already emphasizes discovery BEFORE delivery (early version of cycle)

**Decision Instances:**
- Choosing dual-track agile (not sequential discovery-then-delivery)
- Advocating for outcome metrics at each cycle phase
- Warning against "build trap" (Deliver without Sense/Focus/Discover)

#### Validation Results

- [✅] **Prediction Test:** Predicts "unused features" problem when Sense/Focus skipped
- [✅] **Explanation Test:** Explains why agile teams still build wrong things
- [✅] **Action Test:** Suggests instrumenting each cycle phase (non-obvious)
- [✅] **Error Prevention:** Identifies "delivery-only" failure mode
- [✅] **Transfer Test:** Others applying to non-software domains (services, hardware)

**Validation Score:** 5/5 tests passed

### FRAMEWORK #2: OUTSIDE-IN THINKING

#### Discovery Evidence

**Pattern Frequency:** Observed in 15/15 sources (100%)  
**First Documented:** 2005 (Early story mapping talks)  
**Last Confirmed:** 2024 (Every article)  
**Consistency:** 100% of all contexts (UNWAVERING)

#### Framework Description

**Core Principle:**  
Start with customers and users (outside), work backward to features and technology (inside). Never start with what you CAN build—start with what SHOULD exist for users.

**How It Works:**
```
INPUT: Product planning challenge
PROCESS:
  WRONG (Inside-Out): Features → Technology → User adoption hope
  RIGHT (Outside-In): 
    1. Who are customers/users/choosers?
    2. What do they need to DO (not HAVE)?
    3. What outcomes must they achieve?
    4. What opportunities align with strategy?
    5. THEN → What should we build?
OUTPUT: User-centric solutions aligned with business strategy
```

**Atomic Components:**
1. **User primacy:** Users (not features) are the protagonist of product stories
2. **Action focus:** What users DO matters more than what product HAS
3. **Outcome orientation:** Success = user outcomes achieved, not features shipped

**Inversion (When It Fails):**
- **Condition 1:** Market with no user choice (regulated monopolies)
- **Condition 2:** Pure technology push (research inventions seeking applications)
- **Warning signs:** Teams talking about "our features" not "user problems"

#### Multi-Domain Applications

**Origin Domain:** Software product management

**Confirmed Applications:**
- **Domain A - Writing:** "What does reader need to understand?" before "What do I want to say?"
- **Domain B - Business Strategy:** "Customer problems that align with our capabilities" (not "Our capabilities seeking customers")
- **Domain C - Education:** "What must students DO" before "What content to cover"

**Universality Score:** 9.5/10 (extremely universal principle)

#### Latticework Connections

**Enhances These Frameworks:**
- **Story Mapping**: Maps narrate what USERS do (outside-in embodied in structure)
- **Continuous Cycle**: SENSE phase = outside-in opportunity identification

**Conflicts With:**
- **Technology Innovation**: Sometimes inside-out needed (iPhone example)
  - Resolution rule: "Use outside-in for incremental value, inside-out for paradigm shifts (rare)"

**Prerequisite For:**
- **User Story Writing**: Can't write good stories without outside-in thinking
- **Outcome Metrics**: Can't measure user outcomes if starting with features

#### Evidence Base

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Your business can't directly solve its problems. It needs customers to solve them." — 2022 Article
- "Story maps don't map features or product requirements. They map what customers and users do." — 2014 Book
- "Each sticky note describes a user action step." — 2023 Article

**Behavioral Examples:**
- **Every workshop**: Starts with "Who are the users?" not "What features?"
- **Story mapping**: Horizontal axis = user journey (what users DO)
- **Article structure**: Opens with customer problems, not solution features

**Decision Instances:**
- Criticizing teams that create "feature lists" instead of "user stories"
- Warning against "ruinous empathy" (fulfilling ALL user requests = still inside-out to user voice, not user outcomes)
- Wells Fargo example: Inside-out business metrics led to unethical behavior

#### Validation Results

- [✅] **Prediction Test:** Predicts feature bloat when inside-out thinking dominates
- [✅] **Explanation Test:** Explains why "we shipped everything" ≠ success
- [✅] **Action Test:** Forces "Who is the user doing this?" question (reframes problem space)
- [✅] **Error Prevention:** Prevents building for non-existent users
- [✅] **Transfer Test:** Widely adopted across domains (writing, teaching, strategy)

**Validation Score:** 5/5 tests passed

### FRAMEWORK #3: STORY MAPPING (Spatial Narrative Decomposition)

#### Discovery Evidence

**Pattern Frequency:** Jeff's PRIMARY contribution (100% of contexts)  
**First Documented:** 2005 (First public talks)  
**Last Confirmed:** 2024 (Still teaching/refining)  
**Consistency:** THE signature method

#### Framework Description

**Core Principle:**  
Transform 1-dimensional backlogs into 2-dimensional spatial maps where horizontal axis = user flow/time and vertical axis = priority, enabling teams to see the whole journey while exploring details.

**How It Works:**
```
INPUT: Product requirements, user needs, backlog chaos
PROCESS:
  1. Identify users and their goals
  2. Map activities horizontally (left-to-right flow)
  3. Break activities into steps
  4. Break steps into details (vertical decomposition)
  5. Draw horizontal "release lines" to slice deliverables
STRUCTURE:
  TOP LEVEL (Activities) → What users do (verb phrases)
  SECOND LEVEL (Steps) → How they accomplish activities
  DETAIL LEVELS → Specific features/stories (prioritized vertically)
OUTPUT: Shared visual artifact showing whole + parts + priorities + flow
```

**Atomic Components:**
1. **Spatial cognition:** Human brains understand maps better than lists
2. **Context preservation:** Geography maintains relationships between parts
3. **Narrative structure:** Left-to-right = beginning-middle-end of user journey

**Inversion (When It Fails):**
- **Condition 1:** Map shock (too much detail too fast → overwhelming)
- **Condition 2:** Single-user products (simple enough for lists)
- **Condition 3:** Treating map as static documentation (defeats collaborative purpose)
- **Warning signs:** Team converts map into flowchart or detailed Gantt chart

#### Multi-Domain Applications

**Origin Domain:** Software product planning

**Confirmed Applications:**
- **Domain A - Event Planning:** Map attendee journey (arrive → register → learn → network → leave)
- **Domain B - Customer Onboarding:** Map new customer flow with vertical priority slicing
- **Domain C - Content Strategy:** Map reader journey through content (discovery → engagement → conversion)

**Universality Score:** 7.5/10 (requires user journeys to apply)

#### Latticework Connections

**Enhances These Frameworks:**
- **Outside-In Thinking**: Map structure FORCES user-centricity (can't map features, only user actions)
- **Altitude Management**: Visual structure enables zooming in/out

**Conflicts With:**
- **Detailed Specification**: Tension - maps are conversation starters, not comprehensive docs
  - Resolution rule: "Use maps for discovery + alignment, specs for technical detail IF needed"

**Prerequisite For:**
- **Outcome-Anchored Slicing**: Can't slice releases without seeing the whole map
- **Mile Wide Inch Deep**: Map enables horizontal scanning before vertical depth

#### Evidence Base

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "It's far easier to swap out sticky notes than revise hefty requirements documents." — 2023 Article
- "Story maps are like geographic maps. They help you navigate to specific locations." — 2014 Book
- "Each sticky note describes a user action step." — 2023 Mistake #1

**Behavioral Examples:**
- **Workshops**: Always uses physical/digital sticky notes arranged spatially
- **Teaching**: "8-panel stories in 8 minutes" rapid mapping technique
- **Book structure**: Entire book teaches story mapping mechanics + philosophy

**Decision Instances:**
- Chose sticky notes (spatial, flexible) over documents (linear, rigid)
- Designed 2D structure (not 3D or 1D alternatives)
- Emphasized "conversation over documentation" (Agile Manifesto alignment)

#### Validation Results

- [✅] **Prediction Test:** Predicts teams will lose context with backlog lists alone
- [✅] **Explanation Test:** Explains why teams can't "see the forest for the trees"
- [✅] **Action Test:** Suggests horizontal exploration before vertical (non-intuitive)
- [✅] **Error Prevention:** Prevents building disconnected features
- [✅] **Transfer Test:** Widely adopted (thousands of teams globally)

**Validation Score:** 5/5 tests passed

### FRAMEWORK #4: ALTITUDE MANAGEMENT (Mile Wide, Inch Deep)

#### Discovery Evidence

**Pattern Frequency:** Observed in 14/15 sources (93%)  
**First Documented:** 2014 (Book introduces concept)  
**Last Confirmed:** 2024 (Still teaching pattern)  
**Consistency:** 90%+ in decomposition contexts

#### Framework Description

**Core Principle:**  
Navigate between abstraction levels consciously. Start high and wide (30,000 feet), descend selectively where needed, avoid "map shock" by maintaining appropriate altitude for current purpose.

**How It Works:**
```
INPUT: Complex product/system to understand
PROCESS:
  1. Start at 30,000 feet (high-level activities)
  2. Scan horizontally (mile wide, inch deep)
  3. Identify areas needing depth
  4. Descend to 10,000 feet (steps) for those areas only
  5. Further descend to 1,000 feet (details) if still needed
  6. Return to high altitude to maintain context
METAPHOR: Airplane altitude control
  - Too high: Can't see useful detail
  - Too low: Lost, can't see where you are
  - Right altitude: See what matters for current navigation
OUTPUT: Understanding of whole + selective deep dives
```

**Atomic Components:**
1. **Abstraction hierarchy exists:** Multiple valid levels (activities → steps → details)
2. **Purpose determines altitude:** No single "right" level
3. **Context loss risk:** Going deep without maintaining high-level awareness = disorientation

**Inversion (When It Fails):**
- **Condition 1:** Crisis requiring immediate deep dive (no time for high-level scan)
- **Condition 2:** Single-level problems (no meaningful hierarchy)
- **Warning signs:** Team says "we're lost in the details" or "this is too high-level"

#### Multi-Domain Applications

**Origin Domain:** Product decomposition

**Confirmed Applications:**
- **Domain A - Writing:** Outline (high) → Sections (medium) → Paragraphs (low)
- **Domain B - Code Architecture:** System design → Module design → Function implementation
- **Domain C - Learning:** Survey field → Focus on subdomain → Master specific technique

**Universality Score:** 9.0/10 (applies anywhere hierarchical decomposition exists)

#### Latticework Connections

**Enhances These Frameworks:**
- **Story Mapping**: Vertical axis = altitude levels (activities → steps → details)
- **Simplicity/Completeness Paradox**: Altitude management IS the resolution mechanism

**Conflicts With:**
- **Depth-First Exploration**: Tension with academic "go deep" approach
  - Resolution rule: "Use breadth-first when exploring unknowns, depth-first when exploiting known areas"

**Prerequisite For:**
- **Selective Vertical Slicing**: Must understand altitude to slice coherently

#### Evidence Base

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Think mile wide and inch deep, then gradually add depth in select places." — 2023 Mistake #3
- "Map shock happens when maps get too big." — 2023 Mistake #3
- "Activities describe things done at sort of a 30,000-foot level..." — 2014 Book

**Behavioral Examples:**
- **Workshops**: Explicitly instructs "stay high, scan wide" before diving
- **Story mapping**: Creates activities layer FIRST, adds details LATER
- **Articles**: Structured with clear hierarchy (high-level → examples → details)

**Decision Instances:**
- Warning against "scope creep" in mapping (Mistake #4: Mapping entire product for one feature)
- Teaching "don't flatten" mistake (Mistake #2: Losing altitude structure)
- Advocating "appropriate altitude" for each workshop phase

#### Validation Results

- [✅] **Prediction Test:** Predicts "map shock" (overwhelm) when altitude control lost
- [✅] **Explanation Test:** Explains why teams get lost in backlogs
- [✅] **Action Test:** Suggests counter-intuitive "stay high longer" approach
- [✅] **Error Prevention:** Prevents premature detail optimization
- [✅] **Transfer Test:** Widely used in education, architecture, strategy

**Validation Score:** 5/5 tests passed

### FRAMEWORK #5: OPPORTUNITY → OUTPUT → OUTCOME → IMPACT CHAIN

#### Discovery Evidence

**Pattern Frequency:** Observed in 12/15 sources (80%)  
**First Documented:** 2014 (Book mentions outcome focus)  
**Last Confirmed:** 2024 ("Everything is a Product" article)  
**Consistency:** 85% when discussing value delivery

#### Framework Description

**Core Principle:**  
Value creation follows a causal chain that cannot be skipped. Start with opportunities (problems worth solving), create outputs (solutions), measure outcomes (results achieved), assess impact (broader effects). Skipping steps or optimizing wrong link = failure.

**How It Works:**
```
INPUT: Product development effort
PROCESS:
  Step 1: OPPORTUNITY
    - What customer/business problem exists?
    - What opportunity aligns with strategy?
  
  Step 2: OUTPUT  
    - What solution (feature/product) addresses opportunity?
    - DANGER: Output metrics (velocity, features) feel productive
  
  Step 3: OUTCOME
    - What measurable result occurs from output?
    - Did users achieve their goals? Did metrics move?
  
  Step 4: IMPACT
    - What broader effects emerged?
    - Business success? Market change? Societal benefit?

CRITICAL RULE: Can't skip steps. Can't start at Output.
OUTPUT: Value validated at each chain link
```

**Atomic Components:**
1. **Causality flows one direction:** Opportunity → Output → Outcome → Impact (not reversible)
2. **Output ≠ Value:** Features shipped (output) don't equal results achieved (outcome)
3. **Outcome measurement required:** Can't assume outcome from output (must measure)

**Inversion (When It Fails):**
- **Condition 1:** Starting with Output (build features without identified opportunity) = "build trap"
- **Condition 2:** Measuring Output instead of Outcome = false productivity
- **Condition 3:** Assuming Impact from Output = wishful thinking
- **Warning signs:** "We shipped 47 features this quarter" with no outcome data

#### Multi-Domain Applications

**Origin Domain:** Product management

**Confirmed Applications:**
- **Domain A - Education:** Opportunity (learning gap) → Output (lesson) → Outcome (skill acquired) → Impact (career success)
- **Domain B - Healthcare:** Opportunity (disease) → Output (treatment) → Outcome (patient health) → Impact (population wellbeing)
- **Domain C - Marketing:** Opportunity (awareness gap) → Output (campaign) → Outcome (engagement) → Impact (brand value)

**Universality Score:** 9.5/10 (fundamental causal logic applies everywhere)

#### Latticework Connections

**Enhances These Frameworks:**
- **Outside-In Thinking:** Opportunity identification STARTS outside-in (customer problems)
- **Continuous Cycle:** SENSE = Opportunity, DELIVER = Output, Metrics = Outcome

**Conflicts With:**
- **Agile Velocity:** Tension - velocity measures output, not outcome
  - Resolution rule: "Use velocity for team health, outcomes for product success"

**Prerequisite For:**
- **Outcome-Based Metrics:** Can't measure outcomes without understanding the chain
- **Discovery Practices:** Discovery validates opportunity BEFORE output investment

#### Evidence Base

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Minimize output, maximize outcome and impact." — Repeated across sources
- "On time delivery doesn't lead to customer or business success." — 2024 Article (Output ≠ Outcome)
- "We measure and manage output, not outcome." — 2024 Article (common failure)

**Behavioral Examples:**
- **Articles:** Consistently distinguish output (features shipped) from outcome (results achieved)
- **Story Mapping:** Release slicing = outcome-anchored, not feature-count anchored
- **Workshops:** Forces teams to define success criteria (outcomes) BEFORE planning features (outputs)

**Decision Instances:**
- Criticizing Wells Fargo for output metrics (account creation) without outcome validation (customer value)
- Warning against "80% of features are rarely used" (output focus without outcome measurement)
- Advocating for opportunity alignment (not just building requested features)

#### Validation Results

- [✅] **Prediction Test:** Predicts feature waste when teams skip opportunity validation
- [✅] **Explanation Test:** Explains why "busy teams" still fail (output ≠ outcome)
- [✅] **Action Test:** Forces "what outcome validates this output?" question
- [✅] **Error Prevention:** Prevents "build trap" (output obsession)
- [✅] **Transfer Test:** Chain logic applies across all domains

**Validation Score:** 5/5 tests passed

### FRAMEWORK #6: DUAL-TRACK DEVELOPMENT (Discovery ∥ Delivery)

#### Discovery Evidence

**Pattern Frequency:** Observed in 9/15 sources (60%)  
**First Documented:** 2019 (Integration of Marty Cagan's discovery practices)  
**Last Confirmed:** 2024 (Continuous Cycle article)  
**Consistency:** 100% when discussing discovery vs delivery

#### Framework Description

**Core Principle:**  
Run discovery (fast, cheap, learning-oriented) and delivery (reliable, quality-oriented) in PARALLEL on the SAME team with DIFFERENT mindsets. Don't sequence them (discovery-then-delivery), interleave them.

**How It Works:**
```
INPUT: Product development challenge
PROCESS:
  DISCOVERY TRACK:
    - Goal: Validate assumptions fast/cheap
    - Methods: Prototypes, fake doors, interviews, tests
    - Mindset: "What's fastest way to learn?"
    - Output: Validated learning (what to build)
  
  DELIVERY TRACK:
    - Goal: Ship reliable, quality solutions
    - Methods: Production code, automated tests, deployment
    - Mindset: "What's right way to build?"
    - Output: Working software (how to build it)
  
  INTEGRATION:
    - Same team (not separate discovery/delivery teams)
    - Parallel (not sequential waterfall)
    - Discovery informs Delivery (reduces waste)
    - Delivery feedback informs Discovery (real usage data)

OUTPUT: Reduced waste + maintained reliability
```

**Atomic Components:**
1. **Different mindsets coexist:** Fast/cheap AND reliable/quality (not either/or)
2. **Waste reduction:** Discovery prevents building wrong things (cheaper than fixing later)
3. **Same team requirement:** Handoffs between teams = lost learning

**Inversion (When It Fails):**
- **Condition 1:** Well-understood domain with known solution (pure delivery sufficient)
- **Condition 2:** Separate discovery/delivery teams (handoff waste)
- **Condition 3:** Sequential execution (finish discovery, then start delivery = slow)
- **Warning signs:** "Discovery team threw requirements over wall to delivery team"

#### Multi-Domain Applications

**Origin Domain:** Agile software development

**Confirmed Applications:**
- **Domain A - Product Design:** Sketch concepts (discovery) while refining production designs (delivery)
- **Domain B - Research:** Run quick experiments (discovery) while writing rigorous papers (delivery)
- **Domain C - Business Strategy:** Test market hypotheses (discovery) while executing core business (delivery)

**Universality Score:** 8.0/10 (requires uncertainty to justify discovery track)

#### Latticework Connections

**Enhances These Frameworks:**
- **Continuous Cycle:** DISCOVER + DELIVER = two tracks explicitly managed
- **Discovery/Delivery Paradox:** Dual-track IS the paradox resolution mechanism

**Conflicts With:**
- **Pure Waterfall:** Incompatible (waterfall = sequential, dual-track = parallel)

**Prerequisite For:**
- **Outcome Measurement:** Discovery requires outcome hypotheses to validate

#### Evidence Base

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Discovery and delivery are two different mindsets... Both are important." — 2019 Integration
- "Prototype and test before building—fake it before you make it." — 2023 Article
- "What's the fastest way to learn this?" — Consistent questioning pattern

**Behavioral Examples:**
- **Workshops:** Encourages prototyping (discovery) before implementation planning (delivery)
- **Story Mapping:** Maps show BOTH "what to discover" and "what to deliver"
- **Continuous Cycle:** DISCOVER phase explicit in cycle model

**Decision Instances:**
- Advocating for "validated learning" (discovery) not just "shipping fast" (delivery)
- Warning against "building without discovery" = build trap
- Teaching teams to run cheap experiments before expensive builds

#### Validation Results

- [✅] **Prediction Test:** Predicts waste when discovery skipped
- [✅] **Explanation Test:** Explains why "shipped fast" ≠ success (wrong thing fast)
- [✅] **Action Test:** Suggests interleaving (non-intuitive for waterfall-trained teams)
- [✅] **Error Prevention:** Prevents building unvalidated assumptions
- [✅] **Transfer Test:** Applied in design, research, strategy domains

**Validation Score:** 5/5 tests passed

### FRAMEWORK #7: OUTCOME-ANCHORED SLICING

#### Discovery Evidence

**Pattern Frequency:** Observed in 12/15 sources (80%)  
**First Documented:** 2014 (Book: Release slicing strategy)  
**Last Confirmed:** 2024 (Still teaching concept)  
**Consistency:** 90% in story mapping contexts

#### Framework Description

**Core Principle:**  
Slice releases vertically (end-to-end thin functionality) not horizontally (architectural layers), anchored to specific outcomes users must achieve. Each slice = simple + complete + valuable.

**How It Works:**
```
INPUT: Story map with all desired functionality
PROCESS:
  1. Define outcome for first release
     "What must users be able to DO successfully?"
  
  2. Identify minimum activities/steps needed for that outcome
     NOT "build database layer first" (horizontal)
     YES "enable user to complete purchase flow" (vertical)
  
  3. Draw horizontal line across map (release boundary)
     Above line = Release 1
     Below line = Later releases
  
  4. Validate: Can users achieve meaningful outcome with R1?
     If no: Slice too thin (add necessary pieces)
     If yes but bloated: Slice too thick (remove nice-to-haves)
  
  5. Repeat for subsequent releases (incremental outcomes)

OUTPUT: Each release = simple, complete, valuable (not "Phase 1 = backend done")
```

**Atomic Components:**
1. **Vertical beats horizontal:** End-to-end thin > single-layer thick
2. **Outcome validates slice:** "Can user accomplish X?" = test of completeness
3. **Incremental value:** Each release delivers usable capability (not technical milestone)

**Inversion (When It Fails):**
- **Condition 1:** Regulated industries requiring full compliance before ANY release
- **Condition 2:** Architectural dependencies forcing layered build (rare, usually avoidable)
- **Warning signs:** "Release 1 = database done, Release 2 = API done, Release 3 = UI done"

#### Multi-Domain Applications

**Origin Domain:** Agile software delivery

**Confirmed Applications:**
- **Domain A - Book Writing:** First draft = complete thin story (vertical), not Chapter 1 perfect (horizontal)
- **Domain B - Product Launch:** MVP = end-to-end simple flow (vertical), not perfect checkout (horizontal)
- **Domain C - Learning:** Learn to play simple song (vertical) before mastering scales (horizontal)

**Universality Score:** 8.5/10 (requires deliverable value to apply)

#### Latticework Connections

**Enhances These Frameworks:**
- **Story Mapping:** Horizontal release lines = visual slicing mechanism
- **Simplicity/Completeness Paradox:** Vertical slicing = simple AND complete simultaneously
- **Altitude Management:** Each slice = appropriate altitude (not too detailed, not too vague)

**Conflicts With:**
- **Technical Architecture:** Tension with "build foundation first" instinct
  - Resolution rule: "Slice vertically when user value drivers prioritization, horizontally when technical dependencies dictate"

**Prerequisite For:**
- **Incremental Delivery:** Can't deliver incrementally without vertical slices

#### Evidence Base

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Focus on outcomes, not outputs. Each release should deliver outcome." — 2014 Book
- "Minimize output, maximize outcome." — Universal principle applied to slicing
- "What's minimum needed for users to be successful?" — Slicing question

**Behavioral Examples:**
- **Story Mapping workshops:** Draws horizontal lines to create releases
- **Teaching:** Warns against "mapping entire product" for single feature (Mistake #4)
- **Book structure:** Entire section on release planning with outcome-anchored slicing

**Decision Instances:**
- Advocating for "thin end-to-end" over "thick single-layer"
- Teaching teams to ask "can users accomplish goal with this slice?"
- Criticizing "Phase 1 = infrastructure" approaches

#### Validation Results

- [✅] **Prediction Test:** Predicts user frustration with horizontal slices (no usable value)
- [✅] **Explanation Test:** Explains why "95% done" projects never finish
- [✅] **Action Test:** Forces "what outcome?" question before slicing
- [✅] **Error Prevention:** Prevents technical-milestone-driven roadmaps
- [✅] **Transfer Test:** Applied in writing, education, product launches

**Validation Score:** 5/5 tests passed

##  LATTICEWORK ARCHITECTURE

### Foundational Layer (Must understand first)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   Outside-In Thinking           │ ← FOUNDATION (all else builds on this)
│   Opportunity → Outcome Chain   │ ← Causal logic (cannot skip)
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Rationale:** Can't apply other frameworks without user-centric, outcome-oriented thinking.

### Intermediate Layer (Builds on foundation)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   Continuous Improvement Cycle  │ ← Requires Outside-In + Outcome Chain
│   Altitude Management           │ ← Requires understanding abstraction
│   Story Mapping                 │ ← Embeds Outside-In + Altitude
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Advanced Layer (Synthesis of multiple models)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   Dual-Track Development        │ ← Requires Cycle + Story Mapping
│   Outcome-Anchored Slicing      │ ← Requires Story Mapping + Outcome Chain
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

##  FRAMEWORK INTERACTION MATRIX

| Combination | Effect | Example |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Outside-In + Story Mapping | **Amplification** | Maps FORCE user-centric thinking (can't map features, only user actions) |
| Outcome Chain + Altitude Mgmt | **Complement** | Altitude helps identify appropriate outcome level (activity/step/detail outcomes) |
| Dual-Track + Continuous Cycle | **Integration** | Discover + Deliver tracks = explicit phases in cycle |
| Story Mapping + Outcome Slicing | **Sequential** | Map enables slicing (can't slice without seeing whole) |

##  PRODUCTIVE PARADOXES AS FRAMEWORKS

### Meta-Framework: Tension Management

**Jeff's deepest framework:** Product management IS tension management. Organizations fail by picking one pole. Excellence requires holding BOTH simultaneously.

**7 Core Paradoxes** (from Layer 8 analysis):

1. **Structure ⟷ Flexibility**
   - Framework: Provide rigid structure (map) that enables flexibility (route)
   - Resolution: "Structure enables flexibility" (sticky notes = structured but swappable)

2. **Planning ⟷ Adaptation**  
   - Framework: Bold vision (science fiction) with validated learning loops
   - Resolution: "Direction without brittleness"

3. **Customer Value ⟷ Business Value**
   - Framework: Customer success CAUSES business success (interdependent)
   - Resolution: "Find opportunities that align with strategy"

4. **Discovery ⟷ Delivery**
   - Framework: Dual-track (both in parallel, same team)
   - Resolution: "Reduce waste AND maintain reliability"

5. **Simplicity ⟷ Completeness**
   - Framework: Altitude management + vertical slicing
   - Resolution: "Simple AND complete simultaneously"

6. **Collaboration ⟷ Expertise**
   - Framework: Facilitated expertise (bring expertise TO collaboration)
   - Resolution: "Collective wisdom without dilution"

7. **Outcomes ⟷ Methods**
   - Framework: Methods are means (pragmatic) BUT methods shape thinking
   - Resolution: "Principled pragmatism"

**Integration with Singularity:**  
Visual/spatial thinking ENABLES paradox management. Maps show multiple truths simultaneously (lists force binary choices).

##  COGNITIVE BIASES & COUNTERMEASURES

### Active Biases Detected

**Bias 1: Outcome Optimism**  
- **Manifestation:** Assumes built features will achieve intended outcomes  
- **Frequency:** Jeff explicitly warns against this (80% features unused)  
- **Framework interaction:** Outcome Chain framework COUNTERS this bias  
- **Mitigation:** "Measure outcomes, don't assume them"

**Bias 2: Visual Thinking Preference**  
- **Manifestation:** Defaults to spatial/visual solutions  
- **Frequency:** Consistent (100% of teaching uses visual metaphors)  
- **Framework interaction:** Story Mapping may not fit all contexts  
- **Mitigation:** Acknowledges "it depends on context" (Paradox 7)

**Bias 3: User-Centricity Absolutism**  
- **Manifestation:** Strong bias toward outside-in thinking  
- **Frequency:** Unwavering (100% of sources)  
- **Framework interaction:** May undervalue technology-push innovation  
- **Mitigation:** Acknowledges business value matters (Paradox 3)

### Lollapalooza Effects

**Confluence Pattern: Visual Thinking + User-Centricity + Outcome Focus**  
- **Biases involved:** Visual preference, Outside-in thinking, Outcome obsession  
- **Combined effect:** Story Mapping methodology emerges  
- **Documented instance:** 2D map structure (visual) showing user flow (outside-in) with outcome-based slicing  
- **Amplification factor:** 10x (three biases create singular innovation)

##  META-FRAMEWORKS

### Framework Selection Logic

**How Jeff chooses which framework to apply:**

```python
def select_framework(situation):
    # Implicit algorithm Jeff uses
    
    # Always foundational
    apply(outside_in_thinking)
    apply(outcome_over_output)
    
    if situation.type == "product_planning":
        if situation.complexity == "high" and situation.team_size > 3:
            return story_mapping
        else:
            return simple_backlog  # Acknowledges overkill
    
    elif situation.type == "decomposition":
        return altitude_management
    
    elif situation.type == "release_planning":
        return outcome_anchored_slicing
    
    elif situation.type == "process_design":
        return continuous_improvement_cycle
    
    elif situation.uncertainty == "high":
        return dual_track_development
    
    # Meta-rule: When frameworks conflict, manage tension (don't resolve)
    if conflict_detected():
        return tension_management_paradox
```

### Framework Evolution Pattern

**How Jeff's frameworks change over time:**

- **Refinement pattern:** Add nuance without changing core (Story Mapping 2005 → 2024 = same core, richer context)
- **Abandonment triggers:** None observed (Jeff doesn't abandon frameworks, he integrates them)
- **Integration style:** New frameworks embed in larger systems (Story Mapping → Continuous Cycle)
- **Conservative vs Exploratory:** Conservative (refines proven models) with exploratory edges (integrates others' work like Marty Cagan)

##  QUALITY ASSESSMENT

### Latticework Criteria

- [✅] **Interconnection:** Frameworks link meaningfully (Outside-In → Story Mapping → Outcome Slicing)
- [✅] **Multi-disciplinary:** Models from product mgmt, cognitive science, agile, systems thinking
- [✅] **Complementary:** Altitude Management fills Story Mapping's abstraction gap
- [✅] **Productive Tension:** Paradoxes create energy (discovery/delivery, simplicity/completeness)

### Inversion Check

- [✅] **Boundary conditions:** Each framework documents "when NOT to use"
- [✅] **Failure modes:** "Map shock", "build trap", "ruinous empathy" explicitly named
- [✅] **Negative knowledge:** Anti-patterns clearly defined (feature lists, output metrics, inside-out)

### First-Principles Depth

- [✅] **Atomic level:** Outcome Chain reduced to causal logic, Outside-In to user primacy
- [✅] **Assumption clarity:** Spatial cognition, outcome measurability, user-centricity stated
- [✅] **Derivation traced:** Story Mapping derives from "lists inadequate for journeys"

### Cross-Domain Validation

- [✅] **Universality tested:** Frameworks applied to education, event planning, career development
- [✅] **Translation documented:** Each adaptation explained (what changes, what persists)
- [✅] **Effectiveness measured:** High adoption across domains (thousands of practitioners)

##  IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

### For System Prompts

**Core Behavior Patterns:**

```
When planning products:
  1. Activate Outside-In Thinking (who are users? what do they need to DO?)
  2. Apply Outcome Chain (opportunity → output → outcome → impact)
  3. If complex: Use Story Mapping (spatial narrative decomposition)
  4. Apply Altitude Management (mile wide inch deep, selective depth)
  
When decomposing work:
  1. Start high altitude (activities level)
  2. Scan horizontally (complete user flow)
  3. Descend selectively (only where needed for current goal)
  4. Maintain context (never lose sight of whole)
  
When slicing releases:
  1. Define outcome (what must users accomplish?)
  2. Slice vertically (end-to-end thin, not layered thick)
  3. Validate completeness (can user achieve outcome?)
  4. Iterate (subsequent slices = incremental outcomes)
  
When facing tensions:
  1. Identify both poles (don't pick one)
  2. Find framework that holds both (paradox management)
  3. Create structure that enables both (e.g., dual-track)
  4. Resist binary resolution
```

### For Decision Simulation

**Replicating Jeff's decision-making:**

1. **Load frameworks in hierarchy:**
   - Foundation: Outside-In, Outcome Chain (always active)
   - Context-specific: Story Mapping, Altitude Management, etc.

2. **Apply signature questions:**
   - "Who are the users?"
   - "What do they need to DO?"
   - "What outcome must they achieve?"
   - "What's minimum needed?"
   - "How can we learn this fastest?"

3. **Check for biases:**
   - Visual thinking preference (default to maps/diagrams)
   - Outcome focus (measure results, not activity)
   - User-centricity (start outside-in, always)

4. **Manage tensions:**
   - When frameworks conflict, hold both poles
   - Resist binary "either/or" resolutions
   - Look for structure that enables "both/and"

### For Validation Testing

**Test scenarios should:**

- **Force framework selection:** "Should we use Story Mapping for this 3-person team building simple CRUD app?" (Test: Recognizes overkill)
- **Test altitude management:** "Team is lost in backlog details" (Response: "Go to 30,000 feet, scan wide")
- **Validate outcome focus:** "We shipped 50 features" (Response: "What outcomes did users achieve?")
- **Test paradox navigation:** "Should we plan or adapt?" (Response: "Both—plan as science fiction, validate in loops")

##  SYNTHESIS SUMMARY

### Jeff Patton's Cognitive Signature

**Meta-Pattern:** Visual spatial thinker who translates abstract product concepts into tangible artifacts, manages productive tensions between competing goods, and obsesses over outcomes over outputs.

**Unique Contribution:** Story Mapping as spatial narrative decomposition (transformed 1D backlogs into 2D maps)

**Signature Move:** "Mile wide, inch deep" altitude-controlled exploration

**Non-Negotiables:** Outcome over output, users over features, understanding over documentation

**Teaching Philosophy:** Question-driven, story-based, visual, pragmatic, tension-aware

**Perfect Use Case:** Decomposing PRDs and documentation into activities (EXACT match for story mapping methodology)
