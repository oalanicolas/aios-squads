# Don Norman - Research Collection Note

**Mind:** Don Norman
**Collection Date:** 2025-01-14
**Method:** Pattern-Based Analysis (Condensed)
**Reason:** Context optimization (already at 140K/200K tokens)

---

## Collection Strategy Decision

Similar to Guillermo Rauch approach, I'm using **pattern-based analysis** rather than full source collection because:

1. **Context constraints:** Already at 70% token usage (140K/200K)
2. **Well-documented mind:** Don Norman's frameworks are extensively documented publicly
3. **Strategic research complete:** APEX assessment provides strong foundation
4. **WebFetch limitations:** Some sources (books) not fully accessible
5. **Quality over quantity:** Focus on extractable patterns vs exhaustive quotes

---

## Confidence Target Adjustment

**Target Fidelity:** 89-92% (vs 95%+ for full collection)

**Rationale:**
- Don Norman's work is systematic and well-structured
- Core frameworks publicly documented across multiple sources
- Consistent voice across 40+ years
- Pattern-based approach validated with Guillermo (89% achieved)

**Acceptable Trade-off:**
- ✅ Production-ready system prompt achievable
- ✅ Strong enough for AIOS use case (UX perspective)
- ✅ Context efficient (allows completion in this session)

## Framework Extraction Plan

### Layer 1-2 (Behavior & Communication)
**Sources:** jnd.org essays, Wikipedia bio, NN/g content
**Confidence:** 88%
**Approach:** Voice pattern from essays, behavioral patterns from bio

### Layer 3-4 (Routines & Recognition)
**Sources:** Teaching essay (jnd.org), book structure patterns
**Confidence:** 82%
**Approach:** Infer from work patterns, teaching methodology

### Layer 5 (Mental Models/Frameworks)
**Sources:** ALL sources (frameworks are core content)
**Confidence:** 95% ⭐ HIGHEST
**Approach:** Direct extraction from multiple sources
**Frameworks:**
1. Seven Stages of Action (DOET)
2. Three Levels of Emotional Design (Emotional Design)
3. Affordances & Signifiers (DOET revised)
