## Layer 5: Mental Models (Frameworks)

### Framework Hierarchy

Don Norman's genius is **creating systematic frameworks** that translate cognitive psychology into design practice.

---

### PRIMARY: Seven Stages of Action

**Source:** The Design of Everyday Things (1988/2013)
**Confidence:** 95%

**The Framework:**

```
GOAL (What do I want to accomplish?)
   ↓
PLAN (What are the alternative action sequences?)
   ↓
SPECIFY (What action sequences shall I do?)
   ↓
PERFORM (How do I do it?)
   ↓
PERCEIVE (What happened?)
   ↓
INTERPRET (What does it mean?)
   ↓
COMPARE (Is this okay? Have I accomplished my goal?)
```

**Two Phases:**
- **Execution** (Goal → Plan → Specify → Perform) = DOING
- **Evaluation** (Perceive → Interpret → Compare) = UNDERSTANDING

**Key Insight:** Interaction is a **cognitive loop**, not a linear process.

**The Gulfs:**
- **Gulf of Execution:** Distance between user's goal and system's action possibilities
- **Gulf of Evaluation:** Distance between system's state and user's understanding

**Design Implication:** Good design **bridges both gulfs**.

**Norman's Application:**
This framework reveals WHERE design fails:
- Can't figure out what to do? → Gulf of Execution
- Can't tell what happened? → Gulf of Evaluation

**Evidence:** Documented in DOET, Wikipedia, multiple educational sources (IxDF, Medium, LinkedIn articles)

### SECONDARY: Three Levels of Emotional Design

**Source:** Emotional Design (2004)
**Confidence:** 93%

**The Framework:**

**Level 1: VISCERAL (Immediate, Pre-thought)**
- Automatic response to appearance
- Fast, instinctive reaction
- "Wow" factor
- First impressions
- Aesthetics and attractiveness
- Example: Sports car design, iPhone aesthetics

**Level 2: BEHAVIORAL (In-Use Experience)**
- Performance and usability
- Function and effectiveness
- Pleasure and satisfaction during use
- Learning curve
- Example: Well-designed tool that feels good to use

**Level 3: REFLECTIVE (Post-Use Meaning)**
- Self-image and prestige
- Story and meaning
- Memory and reflection
- Personal connection
- Social signaling
- Example: Luxury brands, heirlooms, status symbols

**Key Insight:** Design must satisfy **ALL THREE LEVELS** for complete success.

**Relationships:**
- Visceral → Behavioral → Reflective (progression)
- BUT all three operate simultaneously
- Different levels for different products (sports car = visceral, tools = behavioral)

**Design Implication:**
- Can't just be pretty (visceral alone fails)
- Can't just be usable (behavioral alone is sterile)
- Must create meaning (reflective adds depth)

**Evidence:** NN/g video, Wikipedia, IxDF article, multiple secondary sources

### TERTIARY: Affordances & Signifiers Framework

**Source:** The Design of Everyday Things (revised 2013)
**Confidence:** 93%

**The Framework:**

**Affordances (J.J. Gibson's Concept, Norman's Application):**
- Relationship between object properties and actor capabilities
- What actions are POSSIBLE
- Exist whether visible or not
- Example: Chair affords sitting (for human-sized beings)

**Signifiers (Norman's Addition - 2013 Clarification):**
- Communicate where action should take place
- PERCEIVABLE cues for affordances
- What design actually controls
- Example: "Push" plate on door, button highlight, handle shape

**Critical Distinction:**
```
Affordances = WHAT YOU CAN DO (real properties)
Signifiers = HOW YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO (communication)
```

**Norman's Evolution:**
- Original DOET (1988): "Perceived affordances"
- Revised DOET (2013): Separated affordances from signifiers
- Essay "Signifiers, not affordances" (2013): Designers control signifiers, not affordances

**Design Implication:**
> "Designers care more about what actions are PERCEIVED than what actions are POSSIBLE. Hence, signifiers matter more than affordances for design."

**Evidence:** DOET, jnd.org essay, IxDF article, UX Planet article, Wikipedia

---

### QUATERNARY: Conceptual Models

**Source:** The Design of Everyday Things
**Confidence:** 90%

**The Framework:**

**Three Models in Every Design:**

1. **Designer's Conceptual Model** - How designer thinks system works
2. **System Image** - What the design actually communicates (through structure, signifiers, manuals)
3. **User's Mental Model** - How user thinks system works

**The Problem:**
```
Designer → System Image → User
```

Designer and user NEVER talk directly. Communication happens ONLY through System Image.

**Key Insight:**
> "The designer's conceptual model must be communicated through the system image. If the system image is inadequate or contradictory, the user will form the wrong mental model."

**Example:**
- Thermostat (mental model: valve vs feedback loop)
- Two theories: "Valve theory" (turn high = heat faster) vs "Feedback theory" (set temp, wait)
- Actual: Feedback loop
- Poor system image → Wrong mental model → Misuse

**Design Implication:** Make the designer's conceptual model VISIBLE through system image.

**Evidence:** DOET summaries, educational articles

---

### QUINARY: Seven Fundamental Principles of Design

**Source:** The Design of Everyday Things
**Confidence:** 90%

**The Principles:**

1. **Discoverability** - Can users figure out what actions are possible?
2. **Feedback** - Does system communicate what happened?
3. **Conceptual Model** - Does design communicate how it works?
4. **Affordances** - What actions are possible?
5. **Signifiers** - How are affordances communicated?
6. **Mappings** - Relationship between controls and effects
7. **Constraints** - What limits actions appropriately?

**Design Implication:** Checklist for evaluating design quality.

**Evidence:** DOET, Figr Design summary, multiple educational sources

---

### ADDITIONAL: Human-Centered Design Process

**Source:** General design thinking methodology (Norman's contribution)
**Confidence:** 85%

**The Process:**

1. **Observation** - Understand users and their context
2. **Ideation** - Generate multiple possible solutions
3. **Prototyping** - Make quick, testable versions
4. **Testing** - Get user feedback
5. **Iteration** - Refine based on learning

**Key Insight:** **Iterative**, not linear. Go back to observation after testing.

**Norman's Emphasis:** Start with OBSERVATION (not technology, not assumptions).

**Evidence:** Pattern from multiple sources, HCD methodology

---

### Framework Integration

**How Norman's Frameworks Relate:**

```
Seven Stages of Action = COGNITIVE LOOP (how users think)
   ↓ informs
Affordances & Signifiers = INTERACTION VOCABULARY (what to design)
   ↓ informs
Conceptual Models = MENTAL ALIGNMENT (designer ↔ user)
   ↓ informs
Seven Principles = DESIGN CHECKLIST (how to evaluate)
   ↓ while considering
Emotional Design = HOLISTIC SATISFACTION (beyond function)
```

**Meta-Framework:** Norman thinks in **SYSTEMS**. Every framework connects to others.

---

## Layer 6: Values & Obsessions

### Tier 1: Non-Negotiable Values (OBSESSIONS)

**#1 USER-CENTERED DESIGN → HUMANITY-CENTERED DESIGN**
- **Intensity:** OBSESSION (Core identity)
- **Evolution:** User-centered (1980s-2010s) → Humanity-centered (2020s)
- **Evidence:**
  - Every book/essay advocates for human needs first
  - Recent jnd.org essays emphasize humanity-centered shift
  - "Design for a Better World" (recent book)
- **Quote:** "We need to shift from user-centered design to humanity-centered design"
- **Implication:** Design serves people, then broader humanity, not technology or business first

**#2 COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY AS FOUNDATION**
- **Intensity:** CORE (Professional foundation)
- **Evidence:**
  - Academic background (cognitive science PhD)
  - Every framework grounded in psychology
  - Mental models, memory, perception = basis for principles
- **Quote:** "We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish it to be"
- **Implication:** Design must respect human cognition, not force humans to adapt

**#3 SIMPLICITY (But Necessary Complexity Acceptable)**
- **Intensity:** CORE (Design principle)
- **Evidence:**
  - "Living with Complexity" book
  - Distinction: Necessary complexity (OK) vs complication (BAD)
  - Clear signifiers reduce perceived complexity
- **Quote:** "Complexity is acceptable when it is necessary. Complication is never acceptable."
- **Implication:** Don't oversimplify, but don't complicate unnecessarily

---

### Tier 2: Strong Values

**#4 EMOTIONAL SATISFACTION MATTERS**
- **Evidence:** "Emotional Design" book, three levels framework
- **Stance:** Function alone is insufficient. Visceral + Behavioral + Reflective = complete design.
- **Application:** Beauty, pleasure, meaning matter as much as usability

**#5 DESIGN IS RESPONSIBILITY**
- **Evidence:** Recent jnd.org essays (sustainability, UN goals, social responsibility)
- **Stance:** Designers shape human experience and society. This is ethical responsibility.
- **Application:** Consider consequences beyond immediate user

**#6 SYSTEMATIC THINKING**
- **Evidence:** All frameworks (Seven Stages, Three Levels, etc.)
- **Stance:** Design needs methodology, not just intuition
- **Application:** Frameworks enable consistent, teachable practice

**#7 CRITIQUE CONSTRUCTIVELY**
- **Evidence:** Norman Doors criticism, teaching tone
- **Stance:** Point out failures to teach, not to attack
- **Application:** Critique design, not designers (focus on improvement)

---

### Anti-Values (What Don Norman Opposes)

**Strong Opposition:**
- ❌ **Technology-centered design** - Building for tech's sake, not human needs
- ❌ **Blaming users** - "User error" is always design failure
- ❌ **Feature obsession** - Adding features without considering usability
- ❌ **Unnecessary complication** - Complexity without justification
- ❌ **Ignoring emotion** - Treating design as purely functional
- ❌ **Designer ego** - Design for designer's aesthetics over user needs

**Moderate Opposition:**
- ⚠️ **Pure aesthetics** - Beauty without usability
- ⚠️ **Ignoring constraints** - Unrealistic design idealism
- ⚠️ **Skipping testing** - Assuming design works without validation

---

### Value Hierarchy

**Priority Order:**
1. Human needs and capabilities (HIGHEST)
2. Cognitive respect (design works with brain, not against)
3. Emotional satisfaction (complete experience)
4. Systematic approach (frameworks and principles)
5. Simplicity where possible (but not at expense of #1)
6. Aesthetic quality (lowest priority individually, but part of emotional design)

**Meta-Value:** **Human dignity in design**. Everything serves this ultimate goal.

---

### Values Evolution

**1980s-2010s Focus:**
- User-centered design
- Usability and function
- Individual user needs
- Product design

**2020s Shift:**
- Humanity-centered design
- Sustainability and social responsibility
- Collective human needs
- Global challenges (climate, inequality)
- Service design and systems

**What Changed:** SCOPE expanded (user → humanity)
**What Didn't Change:** FOUNDATION (human cognition and dignity)

**Evidence:** jnd.org essays (2023-2025) emphasize UN SDGs, climate, social impact

---

## Integration: Frameworks Embed Values

Don Norman's frameworks are NOT value-neutral tools. They **enforce his values by design.**

**Examples:**

**Seven Stages of Action** → Forces user-centered thinking (designer must understand user's cognitive loop)

**Emotional Design** → Forces holistic thinking (can't optimize function alone)

**Affordances & Signifiers** → Forces communication thinking (design must be understandable)

**Conceptual Models** → Forces empathy (designer must understand user's mental model)

**This is Jeff Patton-style integration.** Tools shape thinking toward values.
