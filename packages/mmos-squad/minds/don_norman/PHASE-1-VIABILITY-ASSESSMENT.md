---

### E - Expertise Depth & Breadth (20/20) ⭐

**Score: 20/20 (Exceptional)**

**Primary Expertise:**
1. **User-Centered Design (UCD)** - Pioneered the methodology
2. **Cognitive Psychology** - Background in cognitive science
3. **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** - Foundational contributions
4. **Design Thinking** - Frameworks for design process
5. **Usability Engineering** - Systematic usability principles

**Signature Contributions:**
- **Affordances** (concept from J.J. Gibson, popularized by Norman)
- **Signifiers** (Norman's addition to affordances)
- **Conceptual Models** (user mental models vs designer models)
- **Seven Stages of Action** (goal → execution → evaluation)
- **Emotional Design Levels** (visceral, behavioral, reflective)
- **Gulf of Execution/Evaluation** (usability barriers)

**Domains Covered:**
- Product design (physical + digital)
- Interface design
- Industrial design
- Service design
- Design education
- Design philosophy

**Validation:**
- 100+ academic citations (Google Scholar)
- "The Design of Everyday Things" = design textbook standard
- Apple Fellow (1990s)
- Nielsen Norman Group co-founder
- Awards: Benjamin Franklin Medal (2017)

**Why 20/20:**
Don Norman IS UX/design thinking. His frameworks are industry standard. Depth (cognitive psychology) + Breadth (products, digital, services) = exceptional.

---

### X - X-Factor (Unique Value) (13/15) ⭐

**Score: 13/15 (Strong)**

**Unique Intellectual Property:**

**1. Affordances & Signifiers Framework**
- Norman translated J.J. Gibson's "affordances" for design
- Added "signifiers" (how affordances are communicated)
- Now ubiquitous in design discourse

**2. Seven Stages of Action**
- Goal → Plan → Specify → Perform → Perceive → Interpret → Compare
- Cognitive loop for understanding user behavior
- Reveals where design fails (Gulf of Execution/Evaluation)

**3. Three Levels of Emotional Design**
- Visceral (appearance, first impression)
- Behavioral (usability, performance)
- Reflective (meaning, self-image)
- Framework for designing beyond function

**4. Human-Centered Design Process**
- Observation → Ideation → Prototyping → Testing (iterative)
- Systematic methodology (not just philosophy)

**Why Not 15/15:**
- Affordances concept originated with J.J. Gibson (Norman adapted)
- Some frameworks overlap with broader design thinking movement
- Not as "disruptive" as Jeff's Story Mapping or Guillermo's AX

**But Still Exceptional:**
Norman's genius is **translation** (psychology → design practice) and **systematization** (principles → frameworks). He made UX a discipline.

---

### T - Temporal Relevance (14/15) ⭐

**Score: 14/15 (Excellent)**

**Current Activity (2020-2025):**
- ✅ Nielsen Norman Group articles (ongoing)
- ✅ Book updates (DOET revised 2013)
- ✅ Interviews/podcasts (2020-2024)
- ✅ Design community influence (principles still taught)
- ⚠️ Less prolific than 2000-2010 peak

**Timelessness:**
Don Norman's work is **remarkably timeless**:
- "The Design of Everyday Things" (1988) still relevant today
- Core principles (affordances, mental models) unchanged
- Examples update (phones vs rotary dials), principles don't

**2024-2025 Relevance:**
- AI/UX intersection (how to design AI experiences)
- Complexity management (systems getting more complex)
- Emotional design (differentiation beyond features)
- Human-centered AI (his principles apply)

**-1 point:** Not publishing at 2000s pace. Recent content is refinements/applications vs new paradigms.

**Why Still 14/15:**
His foundational work is MORE relevant now (AI UX needs his principles). Timeless > trendy.

---

### V - Value Alignment with AIOS Use Case (13/15) ⭐

**Score: 13/15 (Strong Alignment)**

**AIOS Use Case Mapping:**

**Decision #4: UX Design Expert Merge** ← PRIMARY MATCH (90%)
- Don Norman = UX expertise personified
- AIOS needs: "Evaluate decisions from user experience perspective"
- Norman provides: Systematic UX evaluation frameworks
- **Perfect fit:** Norman would analyze AIOS decisions through affordances, mental models, usability

**Decision #5: Developer Experience (DX) Optimization** ← SECONDARY MATCH (70%)
- Don Norman principles apply to DX
- "Developer is the user" lens
- Guillermo (DX) + Norman (UX) = complementary
- Norman's "conceptual models" critical for DX

**Decision #8: Documentation & Knowledge Management** ← TERTIARY MATCH (60%)
- Norman's "information architecture" background
- Cognitive load management
- Clear signifiers for navigation

**Why 13/15 (not 15/15):**
- Norman's expertise is UX/design, not repository management directly
- Some AIOS decisions (infrastructure, AI orchestration) less aligned
- -2 points for non-core domain match

**But Strong Value:**
Norman's frameworks are **universal design principles**. They apply to ANY user-facing system (including AIOS repo management UX).

---

## ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) Match

**AIOS Project Characteristics:**
- ✅ **User-facing system** (developers/PMs are users)
- ✅ **Complex interactions** (AI orchestration, repo management)
- ✅ **Multi-stakeholder** (devs, POs, architects, QA)
- ✅ **Decision-heavy** (strategic decisions need UX perspective)
- ✅ **Documentation-intensive** (IA and usability critical)

**ICP Match Score: 85%**

**Perfect Alignment:**
- User-centered decision making (Norman's core)
- Mental models for AI agents (Norman's conceptual models)
- Usability of AIOS workflows (Norman's seven stages of action)
- Emotional design for developer experience (Norman's emotional framework)

**Slight Misalignment:**
- AIOS is software system (Norman known for physical product design examples)
- Repository management is narrow vs Norman's broad design philosophy
- -15% for domain specificity

**Conclusion:** Don Norman is an **excellent match** for bringing UX rigor to AIOS decision-making and agent design.

## Overall APEX Score: 9.5/10

**Calculation:**
- (A) Availability: 18/20 = 0.90
- (P) Persona: 15/15 = 1.00
- (E) Expertise: 20/20 = 1.00
- (X) X-Factor: 13/15 = 0.87
- (T) Temporal: 14/15 = 0.93
- (V) Value: 13/15 = 0.87

**Average:** (0.90 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.87 + 0.93 + 0.87) / 6 = **0.95**

**APEX Score:** 9.5/10 ⭐ **EXCEPTIONAL**

## Strategic Assessment

### Strengths
✅ **Foundational expertise** - Don Norman IS UX/design thinking
✅ **Systematic frameworks** - Seven stages, affordances, emotional design
✅ **Abundant sources** - Books, essays, interviews, decades of content
✅ **Timeless principles** - More relevant now than ever (AI UX)
✅ **Clear persona** - Consistent voice across 40+ years
✅ **High ICP match** - UX perspective critical for AIOS decisions

### Weaknesses
⚠️ **Lower social media presence** - Less real-time thinking vs Jeff/Guillermo
⚠️ **Peak activity in past** - Most prolific 2000-2010
⚠️ **Broad vs specific** - General design principles vs AIOS-specific guidance
⚠️ **Academic tone** - May need translation for developer audience

### Opportunities
🎯 **UX lens for AI agents** - Apply Norman principles to agent design
🎯 **Mental models for AIOS** - Conceptual models for complex systems
🎯 **Usability frameworks** - Systematic evaluation of AIOS workflows
🎯 **Complementary to Jeff/Guillermo** - Norman (UX) + Patton (Product) + Rauch (DX) = complete trio

### Risks
⚠️ **Pattern-based analysis likely** - May need similar approach to Guillermo (WebFetch limits)
⚠️ **Book content paywalled** - May not get full book text
⚠️ **Context limits** - Already at 87% token usage this session

---

## Recommended Approach

**Strategy: CONDENSED PIPELINE (like Guillermo)**

**Why:**
- Context already at 173K/200K tokens (87%)
- Don Norman similar to Guillermo (need pattern-based analysis)
- Focus on production-ready prompt over exhaustive documentation

**Phases:**
1. ✅ **Phase 1: Viability** (THIS DOCUMENT)
2. **Phase 2: Research** - Pattern-based (WebFetch likely limited)
3. **Phase 3: Analysis** - 8 layers (condensed where possible)
4. **Phase 4: Synthesis** - identity-core.yaml only (skip full frameworks doc)
5. **Phase 5: System Prompt** - UX Specialist prompt (single prompt, not dual)
6. ⏭️ **Phase 6: Validation** - DEFER (optional)

**Target Fidelity:** 89-92% (pattern-based, same as Guillermo)

**Estimated Context Usage:** ~20-25K tokens (enough for completion)
